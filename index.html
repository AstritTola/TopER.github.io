    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Graph embeddings play a critical role in graph representation learning, allowing
machine learning models to explore and interpret graph-structured data. However,
existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting
interpretability and practical visualization.
      <p>
        <p>
In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, lowdimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER
simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the
evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of
graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and
classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art
results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as
classification, clustering, and visualization.

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Graphs are fundamental data structures modeling social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and more. 
      Classical graph representation methods often overlook high-order topological patterns. 
      TopER leverages persistent homology to capture the evolution of topological features across multiple filtration levels, 
      creating embeddings that reflect the intrinsic graph structure.
    </p>

  <!-- METHODOLOGY -->
  <section id="method">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The core of TopER is TopoScan, a module that computes the evolution of graph substructures across filtrations. 
      These sequences are fed into a transformer architecture, generating embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. 
      TopER can be applied to various graph types, from molecular graphs to social networks.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      TopER achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets including BZR, COX2, MUTAG, PROTEINS, and IMDB-B. 
      The embeddings demonstrate robustness, scalability, and improved classification accuracy over traditional graph neural networks.
